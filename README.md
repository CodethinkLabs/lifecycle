User Lifecycle Management
=========================

Some software we use doesn't have good user lifecycle management.  While we can use SSO to log into
these pieces of software, we end up with ghost users, manual user management, and worse of all, users
with non-sso authentication methods.

This software is intended to run automatically, and perform full user lifecycle management for these 
applications.
