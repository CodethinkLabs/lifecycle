# Contributing to lifecycle

tl;dr: Open an issue, send a MR.  If it isn't getting looked at poke in #lifecycle.

If something isn't part of the project spec, or hasn't been discussed beforehand
it might not get merged, beware!

Chat to us in #lifecycle if you've got any ideas you're interested in contributing.
