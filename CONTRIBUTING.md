# Contributing to lifecycle

tl;dr: Open an issue, send a MR.  If it isn't getting looked at poke in #co078.

If something isn't part of the project spec, or hasn't been discussed beforehand
it might not get merged, beware!

Chat to us in #co078 if you've got any ideas you're interested in contributing.

## Merge Requests

* Must have `black` run against every commit.  This is enforced by CI.
* Should have their history rewritten to group things nicely together.
